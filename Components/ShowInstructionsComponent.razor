            <p><strong>Instructions for using the Drawing Number:</strong></p>
            <p>When you generate a drawing number, use it to search for CAD files on the network drive. The drawing number helps you find specific files like CAD drawings, manuals, PDFs, and more.</p>

            <p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drop-down Menus:</strong> Each part of the drawing number comes from choices in drop-down menus. You can leave parts out by using asterisks (*). For example, if you don't need to specify the belt type, you can use * to search more broadly.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Asterisks Strategically:</strong> Add an asterisk (*) in place of parts of the drawing number that aren’t important to your search. This widens your search to include similar belts.</li>
                <li><strong>Search Example:</strong> If your drawing number is <code>123-M-ABC-456</code>, and you want to search for all belts of a similar type but not the exact same, try <code>123-*-ABC-456</code>. This will find belts with the same part numbers but different belt types.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-2"><strong>Tip:</strong> This makes it faster to find related parts and documentation for special builds.</p>

            <p class="mt-2"><strong>Best Practice:</strong> When you don't know the full drawing number, using asterisks (*) helps you get a wider search. Just be sure to keep the important parts, like part numbers, as they are.</p>

            <div class="mt-2">
                <strong>Summary of Steps:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Generate the drawing number using the form.</li>
                    <li>Copy it to the clipboard and paste it in the network search.</li>
                    <li>Use asterisks in place of non-critical parts of the drawing number to widen your search for similar builds.</li>
                </ol>

        <!-- Export JSON Button Instructions -->
        <div class="alert alert-info mt-2">
            <p><strong>Export JSON Button:</strong></p>
            <p>This button allows you to export the data from the form in a concise JSON format. It’s useful for storing project details or sharing with team members without manually inputting each field.</p>
            <p class="mt-2"><strong>How to leverage it for faster data entry:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-fill Projects:</strong> Use the JSON export feature to save previous configurations. This can act as a template for new projects, allowing you to quickly load and adjust parameters instead of starting from scratch.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Exporting data as JSON makes it easier to reference multiple projects and avoid re-entering repetitive information. Simply load the JSON to fill out the fields instantly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-2"><strong>Tip:</strong> When exporting JSON, be sure to use consistent naming conventions and structure for quick retrieval later.</p>
