<h1>Habasit Tools Overview</h1>
<small>Author: Thomas Smith II | CAD Drafter | 10/14/2024</small>

<hr>

<p>
    This CAD app suite will include a set of .NET 8, C# 12 applications and services designed to streamline and automate CAD drafting, project management, and data handling for multiple drafters at Habasit America. 
    The solution will be cross-platform, with Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) where applicable, to provide offline capabilities and will focus on asynchronous communication with each drafter's local SolidWorks API instance. 
    This will include a high-performance web API for network-hosted services, ensuring scalability and rapid development.

<h2>High-Level Architecture Outline</h2>

<h3>Shared Class Library Strategy</h3>
<p>The goal of shared libraries is to encapsulate reusable functionality that can be leveraged by multiple apps and services, ensuring that the code remains DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and easy to maintain. The following core domains are abstracted into shared libraries:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>SolidWorks API Interactions</b>: Seamless communication with local SolidWorks instances, enabling automated access to models, assemblies, and drawing generation.</li>
    <li><b>PDM & ERP Integration (Windchill, Epicor)</b>: Manages synchronization and communication between SolidWorks, PDM, and ERP systems.</li>
    <li><b>Metadata & BOM Automation</b>: Automates extraction and synchronization of metadata and Bill of Materials (BOM) between SolidWorks files, ERP, and PDM systems.</li>
    <li><b>Common Utilities (Validation, Logging, Caching)</b>: Provides reusable utilities for validation, logging, and caching across services.</li>
    <li><b>Web API Client Services</b>: Client-side functionality for interacting with the Web API, facilitating smooth data transfer between web clients and backend services.</li>
    <li><b>Authentication & Authorization</b>: Manages user identity and role-based access control across the suite.</li>
    <li><b>File & Folder Management</b>: Handles file naming conventions, storage, and project folder organization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Front-End Layer</h3>
<p><b>Blazor WebAssembly PWA</b>: The primary cross-platform interface for CAD drafters, providing offline capabilities and a responsive design for multiple devices. Integrates with SolidWorks for tasks like drawing number generation, project folder creation, and file categorization.</p>

<h3>Backend Layer</h3>
<p><b>ASP.NET Core Web API</b>: The server-side logic, handling requests, data processing, and communication with external systems like SolidWorks PDM, Epicor ERP, and SugarCRM.</p>

<h3>Integration with External Systems</h3>
<p>Integrates with external systems such as SugarCRM, Epicor ERP, and SolidWorks, facilitating data flow for part numbers, materials, and orders.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This architecture is designed for performance, scalability, and maintainability, supporting a robust suite of tools to automate workflows for multiple CAD drafters while integrating with key systems like SolidWorks, SugarCRM, and Epicor ERP.</p>



  <h2><strong>Risk Mitigation Strategy for CG</strong></h2>
