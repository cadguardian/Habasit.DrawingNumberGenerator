SB Plastic Drawing Database Design Rules

1. BeltTypeCode, BeltSeriesCode, ColorCode, MaterialCode, AdderMaterialCode, RodMaterialCode should come from a pre-defined set of values. Yes create lookup tables. The applicable lookup tables will have a code and the corresponding value data type may be different.

2. BeltWidthCode is a code. For example belt width value is a decimal while the BeltWidthCode is a string.

3. FlightsRollersGripsCode is a code and should have a lookup table.

4. QtyRollersAcrossWidth, FRGCenters are always decimals and should have maximum value of 256

5. BeltAccessoriesCode, FrictionAntiStaticCode, SidePLLaneDVCode are codes and should have lookup tables. A belt cannot have multiple accessories, or multiple friction-reducing treatments?

6. UniqueIdentification will be a string and does not serve as the primary key and should not be auto-generated by the database. But all lookup table items will require its own id primary key. You can decide the data type that best suites my goals and database design best practices. The primary key id should be auto-generated by the database.
