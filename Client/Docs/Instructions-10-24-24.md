# Drawing Number Generator Tool Instructions
### **Purpose of the Drawing Number Generator Tool**
The Drawing Number Generator Tool is specifically designed for CAD Drafters at Habasit America in Suwanee, GA, to support special-build plastic modular belting products. It serves as a collection of essential tools, aligning the CAD drafting process with the broader business strategy to maximize efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability. By combining, documenting, and implementing collected knowledge, this tool significantly impacts business outcomes and onboarding ease. The Drawing Number Generator streamlines the end-to-end workflow, from receiving drawing requests from the CSR team to delivering production-ready CAD drawings.

### **1. Filling Out the Form Completely**
Complete all sections of the form to generate the correct drawing number and ensure data integrity:
- **Belt Specifications** (e.g., type, color, material)
- **Belt Accessories** (e.g., cleats, flights, guides)
- **Friction/Anti-Static Options** (e.g., low friction coating)
- **Side-PL/Lane-DV Options** (e.g., side walls, lane dividers)
- **Unique Identification Details** (e.g., customer-specific requirements)

### **2. Identifying Constraints and Strategy**
The description of each part in the table provides vital details like part type (module, flight, etc.), dimensions, color, material, number of links, and link position (left edge, right edge, middle). This information helps you understand constraints and plan your assembly (bricklay) strategy. Using this tool, you can ensure the correct CAD templates and AutoCAD blocks are utilized, resulting in accurate bills of materials, clear assembly guides, and fewer revisions downstream. Precision at this stage directly impacts project outcomes, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

### **3. Generating and Using the Drawing Number**
Toggle the switch to generate a unique drawing number and corresponding query string. Use the query string to search the network drive for existing drawings. When searching, include asterisks (*) for fuzzy matching. If no match is found, name new drawing files using the generated number for consistency and traceability. Adherence to this procedure enhances data integrity and ensures that our design standards are uniformly applied across all special builds.

### **4. Finding Available Parts Using the Part Table**
Click the filter button above the part table to apply both universal and specific filters. Narrow the results using the part number search bar. If the results are too narrow, clear the search bar and filter again. Carefully review part descriptions for compatibility, constraints, and strategic placement within assemblies. Proper selection and identification of parts are crucial for optimizing assembly and inventory accuracy, thereby enhancing our overall operational throughput.

### **5. Summarizing the Form**
Click "Summarize Form" to review all input data and verify the applicable belt codes. This step helps mitigate errors and ensures the completeness of all required information before generating or finalizing a drawing number. It acts as a checkpoint to enhance data integrity and reduce rework, aligning with key performance metrics related to first-time-right quality standards.

### **6. Accessing Product Portal and Assembly Guides**
Utilize the quick-access links at the top of the page to open the product portal and assembly guides. This functionality is essential for verifying specific belt configurations, accessing real-time part data, and ensuring that assembly techniques are consistently aligned with company standards and customer requirements.

### **Pro Tips for Data Entry**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move between fields and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to go back. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to submit quickly.
- **Asterisk Usage:** Replace non-critical parts of the drawing number with an asterisk (*) for fuzzy searches (e.g., 123-M-ABC-456 to 123-*-ABC-456).
- **Form Visibility Toggle:** Click "Summarize & Hide Form" to focus on summarized information while verifying accuracy.
- **Exporting Data as JSON:** Use the export feature to save form configurations for easy reloading in future projects, optimizing repeat processes and reducing the time required for similar builds.
