#### **Code Snippet: Creating a New Part**

```csharp
using System;
using SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks;
using SolidWorks.Interop.swconst;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialize SolidWorks application
        SldWorks.SldWorks swApp = new SldWorks.SldWorks();
        swApp.Visible = true;  // Make the application visible

        // Create a new part document
        ModelDoc2 swModel = (ModelDoc2)swApp.NewDocument("Part", 0, 0, 0);
        
        // Save the part document
        string filePath = @"C:\Path\To\Save\NewPart.SLDPRT";
        swModel.SaveAs(filePath);

        Console.WriteLine("New part created and saved at: " + filePath);
    }
}
```

This code:

    titleBlock.Text = $"Part Number: {partNumber}\nMaterial: {material}";
    
    // Save the drawing with updated title block
    drawing.Save();
}
```

This code helps automate the updating of the title block with **Part Number** and **Material** from a model, ensuring that each drawing always contains the latest information.

### 5. **Importing Sketches from a Library**

For efficiency, importing standard sketches from a library (e.g., for fasteners, modular belt components) can save time and reduce errors. SolidWorks API allows for importing standard sketches or components from a part library and placing them in the current model.

#### **Use Case**:
- **Standardized Sketches**: Use for recurring components like fasteners or specific belt components, ensuring design consistency.
- **Library Management**: Manage sketches in a folder structure and import them into designs dynamically.

#### **Code Snippet for Importing a Sketch from a Library**:

```csharp
using SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks;
using SolidWorks.Interop.swconst;

public void ImportSketchFromLibrary(ModelDoc2 swModel, string libraryPath, string sketchName)
{
    // Load the sketch from the library
    Sketch sk = swModel.SketchManager.InsertSketchFromFile(libraryPath + "\\" + sketchName + ".SLDPRT");
    
    // Place the imported sketch in the current model
    swModel.SketchManager.CreateSketch();
    swModel.SketchManager.AddSketch();
    
    Console.WriteLine("Sketch imported and placed.");
}
```

This snippet imports a sketch (such as a fastener sketch) from a library into the current model, reducing the need for manual drawing creation.

### Conclusion

By focusing on **part parameters**, **drawing automation**, **assembly management**, **title block updates**, and **sketch imports**, you can significantly optimize the design process for **modular belts** and **conveyor systems**. These capabilities streamline workflows, improve consistency, and automate repetitive tasks that would otherwise take significant manual effort. The provided code snippets can be tailored further to meet the specific needs of **Habasit America**'s design standards.
