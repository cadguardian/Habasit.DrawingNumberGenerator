Here’s the updated roadmap, incorporating your additional requirements and focusing on the special build plastic modular belting scope. This adjusted plan follows the order of products based on common demand and aligns with a future PDM migration while remaining functional without it.

### Technical Roadmap Flowchart

1. **Start**: Define Overall Goals for Special Build Plastic Modular Belting CAD Standardization

2. **Phase 1: Initial Setup and Prioritization of Common Products**
   - **Identify Obsolete Products**:
     - Conduct an audit to identify and remove or archive obsolete products, ensuring no time is wasted on unnecessary models.
   
   - **Product Prioritization**:
     - Start with **Habasit** products (highest priority), followed by **Common KVP** products, and lastly, **Everything Else**. This sequence ensures that the most frequently ordered products are completed first.

3. **Phase 2: CAD File Creation and Organization (Highest Priority)**
   - **AutoCAD Blocks and SolidWorks Templates**:
     - Develop standardized base shapes and layouts in AutoCAD for commonly used modules.
     - Import these blocks into SolidWorks, ensuring compatibility and alignment with SolidWorks template structures.
     - Set up SolidWorks templates to support rapid part and assembly creation, with views, dimensions, and title blocks predefined.
   
   - **Read-Only CAD Files**:
     - Make all library files read-only to prevent unintended modifications.
     - Restrict permissions on template files so they cannot be overwritten, preserving the integrity of standardized components.

4. **Phase 3: Metadata and Revision Control**
   - **Revision Control in File Names**:
     - Maintain revision numbers within the CAD file names, ensuring traceability without relying on PDM.
     - Establish a consistent format for revision updates to simplify tracking and align with future PDM migration.
   
   - **Custom Properties Integration**:
     - Link essential custom properties (e.g., belt type, pitch, subgroup) to your product data table, using the SolidWorks API for automatic population.
     - Standardize metadata across all files, allowing for easy migration to PDM while ensuring efficient data retrieval and consistency.

5. **Phase 4: Feature-Based Modeling and Assembly Integrity**
   - **Feature and Assembly Templates**:
     - Develop standardized feature templates for repetitive components, like belt extrusions or guides.
     - Constrain features to enforce orientations and consistency, reducing errors and setup time.
   
   - **Pack and Go Reference Integrity**:
     - Ensure that all assembly files retain clean references after using Pack and Go, preserving the linkages between parts and assemblies.
     - Implement reference validation routines to confirm that assemblies maintain integrity, preventing broken references during updates.

6. **Phase 5: Compliance, Legal Documentation, and Quality Control**
   - **Legal Compliance and Well Notes**:
     - Embed well notes and legal compliance notes in relevant files to streamline quality control and regulatory checks.
     - Document practical notes based on production experience, aiding in efficient interpretation and implementation.

   - **Windchill Alignment**:
     - Set up basic traceability procedures for high-risk parts without full PDM.
     - Maintain consistent file versioning practices to facilitate a smoother transition to Windchill or another PDM system when ready.

7. **Phase 6: Maintenance and User Training**
   - **Quarterly Library Reviews**:
     - Schedule quarterly updates to ensure files remain current and reflect any process or product changes.
     - Archive any newly obsolete files to keep the library focused and relevant.
   
   - **User Training and Documentation**:
     - Train team members on standards for part and assembly creation, revision control, and using templates correctly.
     - Provide documentation on the CAD standards, detailing revision tracking, file referencing, and best practices for working without PDM.

### Summary of Priority

1. **Initial File Setup (AutoCAD and SolidWorks Templates, Read-Only Permissions)** – Focus on Habasit products first.
2. **Metadata and Revision Control** – Ensure each file has the necessary information and follows revision standards.
3. **Assembly Integrity and Reference Control** – Validate Pack and Go procedures.
4. **Legal Compliance and Documentation** – Include compliance and practical notes within files.
5. **Maintenance and User Training** – Regular updates and consistent training for effective use.

This roadmap prioritizes efficient CAD library setup and organization while preparing for a seamless PDM migration, making the strategy resilient and aligned with long-term goals. Let me know if you have further refinements or need additional details in any phase.
