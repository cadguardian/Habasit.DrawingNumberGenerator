Shape, space, pattern optimization and interlocking geometrical patterns, are fundamental to my every day tasks as a CAD Drafter for Habasit America in Suwanee, GA. 

I currently manually draft the companies most complex special build plastic modular belt assemblies. These belt assemblies are configured quite literally like jigsaw puzzles in 2D.

I use AutoCAD 2024 LT, a library of 105 distinct families of interlocking 2D AutoCAD blocks that serve as the individual "puzzle pieces" that make up the belt assembly. I also reference a library of 25,000 drawings of previously delivered belts to serve as training data and future job templates. These drawings typically include a top, front and side view for reference and are stored on a on premise network drive.

There are a few constraints i must abide by when assemblying the "puzzle" The parts (AutoCAD blocks) can be exploaded and cut but not extended, to fit within the belt assembly specified boundaries which is defined by the customer specified belt width in inches, belt length in linear feet and square feet. The parts must never overlap, intersect and have a consistent clearances. In terms of layout, aim for symmetry, minimally processed parts (cut, modified) and simplicity.

I am expected to deliver a project package every 20 minutes. The package includes a 2d belt assembly model and dimensioned fabrication drawings. A drawing package typically includes 1 sheet for the assembly, 1 sheet per distinct part, accompanied with a parts list, cutlist and accessories list. 

I am currently exploring spatial reasoning and math to eliminate 80% of my manual tasks and activities.     

As a response to recent demand and access to technological advancements, I have gained the ability to create C# 12, .NET 8, Blazor applications that communicates with the solidworks 2023 API.

Lets discuss my required outputs further, starting with the most important, the dimensioned drawing.

The drawing number convention is made up of a sequence of codes that represent categories and attributes of the requested product. The codes are in a specific order and typically hold a range of 1 to 6 characters per code. The order of the codes are as follows in this comma delimited list: 

BeltType,BELTSERIES,Color,Material,AdderMat'l,RodMaterial,BeltWidth,Flights/Rollers/Grip,Qty.RollersAcrossWidth,F/R/GCenters,BeltAccessories,Friction/AntiStatic,Side-PL/Lane-DV,IndentCode 

The cutlist is a table with the following columns: raw material number, raw material quantity, raw material length in inches, raw material width in inches, processed part number, special process, number of raw materials consumed to produce finished goods, finished good length in inches, finished good width in inches, maximum parts per raw material, material color

The accessory list may include item number, quantity, and part number.

The parts could include part #, quantity, description, color, typical specs

Lets explore key math concepts, including shapes, sizes, and how and where one puzzle piece fits with another to make designs. 

Imagine what something would look like if it were changed, such as rotated or flipped. Spatial words such as straight, flat, curved, edge, inside, outside, long, and short helps thinking about spatial relationships. 

Communication is what turns a design from a draft to a fabricated and delivered product. Here are examples of how my team and I communicate.

The number of pieces depends on current complexity level. It can be difficult to put puzzle pieces in the correct spots so guiding cad drafters to find the right pieces through spatial words (“You need a piece with a flat edge, like this one,” or “You almost touched it!”) works well because it lets cad drafters practice their spatial thinking.

I point out features of puzzle pieces. “That piece is short and curved. We need a long triangle. Do those parts interlock?”

Describe the blank spaces where puzzle pieces go. “We’re looking for two edge pieces here, one for the right side of the puzzle and one for the top of the puzzle. Both will have straight sides.”

Ask questions about different puzzle pieces. “How do you know that piece fits over there? Do you think this piece will fit—why or why not?”

Give clues and prompts to help cad drafters find the right piece. “That piece is upside down. What happens if you flip it and turn it sideways?”

Use symbols, as well as words, to explain. “This is a corner piece.” (Point to the corner). “It has two flat edges. This puzzle has four corners. Let me show you.” (Point to each corner.)

Spatial awareness and spatial relations allow children to locate objects and navigate successfully in their environments

 Pay attention to features of objects, name and categorize objects, know that it is part of a whole object. Be capable of recognizing objects in different orientations. Coordinate movement and alignment of 2D objects. Spatial language includes words describing location/position (under, in front of), attributes (long, high, side, angle, same, symmetrical), orientation and mental transformation (left, turn, match), and geometric shape names (rectangular prism, triangle, sphere).
